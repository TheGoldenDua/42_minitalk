## 🧠 Overview

**Minitalk** is a project that introduces students to **inter-process communication (IPC)** using UNIX signals.  
The goal is to create a small client-server program where the client can send messages to the server using **`SIGUSR1`** and **`SIGUSR2`** signals.  

This project teaches low-level process control, signal handling, and bitwise operations while reinforcing **C fundamentals**.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

- Learn to send and receive messages using UNIX signals  
- Handle asynchronous signal communication reliably  
- Convert characters into binary and transmit bit by bit  
- Implement proper error handling and process management  
- Ensure robust communication even with large messages
